# Project: Empower - Empowering Students to Impact Through Code


At **Project: Empower**—a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that brings students together to create software based solutions to problems impacting the first-generation and low-income community. 

At Project: Empower, we strive to inspire students to take action whenever they recognize a problem and to work alongside others who share their ambitions. If you want to personally make an impact through our existing initiatives or to start your own project, let us know, and we’ll connect you with mentors and teams to bring your ideas from imagination to reality. You can also gain __volunteer hours__ that are eligible for the Presidential Volunteer Service Award for dedicated time.

Challenging problems aren't meant to be taken on alone, and at Project: Empower, you don't have to.
